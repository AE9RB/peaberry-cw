System Requirements
-------------------
Windows Vista/7/8 or newer
Mac OS X 10.7 or newer


Windows Notes
-------------
The Peaberry SDR device driver (libusb-win32) must be properly installed.
The construction manual provides information about this.

The Visual C runtime must be on your system. It probably is already if you
have installed other applications. If not, run vcredist_x86.exe to install it.

There's no installer for Peaberry CW. Unzip the files and run PeaberryCW.exe.
Nothing is stored in the registry. Settings are stored in your user directory.
Microsoft makes this a moving target but here's a couple places it might be:

C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\AE9RB\PeaberryCW.ini
C:\Documents and Settings\YourUserName\Application Data\AE9RB\PeaberryCW.ini

Peaberry CW uses WASAPI exclusive-mode for its audio interface. You will not
hear sounds from other applications while Peaberry CW is running. This is
intentional and unavoidable. Because this API is only used for professional
audio, some device drivers may be optimistically reporting more capabilities
than are actually present. Peaberry CW does its best to detect these bogus
drivers but there's no 100% certain way to do so.

If you're having troubles with sound output, you can force the application to
skip trying the better method by setting eventSpeaker=false in PeaberryCW.ini.


Macintosh Notes
---------------
No driver, runtime, or special consideration for audio is needed.
Simply run PeaberryCW.app. Settings are stored in the Mac OS X defaults
system and may be deleted with this command:

$ defaults delete com.ae9rb.PeaberryCW
